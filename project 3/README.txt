# CS342-Project-3
Implementation of Buddy memory allocation algorithm using c static linking.

# How To Run?
You need the have the following programs: 'gcc' and 'ar' and 'make'. To run the program just type 'make' to the console. This will generate the object library and executable files. Then it will automatically run the driver function. Note that the driver function is written in main. Enjoy.

# This project is made by Ufuk Bombar and Ant Duru

# Notes
This implementation has problems and does not fully integrate with a multiprocessing environment however, we are confident that this implementation will be compatible with pthread library.
